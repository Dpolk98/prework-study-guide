# Prework Study Guide


## Description

The concept of a study guide as a custom built website made an excellent first challenge to learn and practice web dev skills simultaneously. I built this to accomplish those two goals, and it helps me practice not only the practical writing, debugging, and deployment of code, but also being forced to re-read the notes I've written helps me memorize what I deemed important enough to write down. I learned how to work in Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this project.
